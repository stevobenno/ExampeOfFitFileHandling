This plugin for the [SportTracks](http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks) software is meant to replace part of Garmin Training Center (GTC).  As such, this plugin allows you to create and edit the advanced workouts and profiles that can then be sent to fitness units.  Even though this is meant to replace GTC you will find a better integration with [SportTracks](http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks) via the usage of [SportTracks](http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/SportTracks) categories.  This plugin also implements the latest units targets such as power and some user friendly features like drag & droping, copy-pasting and more.
